Monitor security posture: This is the primary role of the SOC, and it includes monitoring the network and computers for security alerts and notifications and responding to them as the need dictates.
Vulnerability management: This refers to finding vulnerabilities in the company systems and patching (fixing) them. The SOC can assist with this task but not necessarily execute it.
Malware analysis: The SOC might recover malicious programs that reached the network. The SOC can do basic analysis by executing it in a controlled environment. However, more advanced analysis requires sending it to a dedicated team.
Intrusion detection: An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to detect and log intrusions and suspicious packets. The SOC’s job is to maintain such a system, monitor its alerts, and go through its logs as the need dictates.
Reporting: It is essential to report incidents and alarms. Reporting is necessary to ensure a smooth workflow and to support compliance requirements.

Network security monitoring (NSM): This focuses on monitoring the network data and analyzing the traffic to detect signs of intrusions.
Threat hunting: With threat hunting, the SOC assumes an intrusion has already taken place and begins its hunt to see if they can confirm this assumption.
Threat Intelligence: Threat intelligence focuses on learning about potential adversaries and their tactics and techniques to improve the company’s defences. The purpose would be to establish a threat-informed defence.
